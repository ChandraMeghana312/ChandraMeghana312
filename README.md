Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I am Chandra Meghana, a dedicated and highly motivated Computer Science professional based in Dallas, TX. With a passion for technology and a keen interest in problem-solving, I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science from Lamar University, where I specialized in cutting-edge areas such as Cloud Computing, Big Data, and Software Engineering.

During my journey as a Java Developer at Brillfy Technology Inc., I actively contributed to the development of a healthcare application, employing Java 11, Angular 14, and AWS services. My work significantly improved patient record management and ensured seamless healthcare data handling, thereby enhancing patient safety and medical workflow. Additionally, I successfully integrated healthcare APIs, conducting insurance eligibility checks and medication verification for optimized patient care and treatment precision.

As a Graduate Research Assistant at Lamar University, I honed my analytical and research skills by delving into large weather-related datasets. I developed algorithms in Python and utilized Oracle SQL database and statistics to achieve a 9% improvement in accuracy performance for calculating wind resultant.

Prior to that, I had the privilege of serving as a Systems Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services(TCS), where I contributed to the development, enhancement, and troubleshooting of various products using Java, Angular, HTML, JavaScript, and REST APIs.

My expertise extends to a wide range of programming languages and tools, including Java (Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA), C++, Python, Angular, CSS, Typescript, HTML, SQL Server, MySQL, AWS, and Git.

I am passionate about learning and thrive in collaborative environments where innovation is encouraged. I am currently seeking new opportunities to contribute my skills and expertise to impactful projects.
